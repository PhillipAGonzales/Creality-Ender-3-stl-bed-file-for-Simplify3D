# Creality-Ender-3-stl-bed-file-for-Simplify3D

Creality Ender-3 stl bed file for Simplify3D with guide and fff profile

This is an .stl file for the bed [complete lower part of printer] of Creality Ender-3 to be imported into SImplify3D!

Also included an .fff profile that has been created combining a lot of other fff files and a lot of testing that contains the bed!

you can do it in two ways:

1st WAY
-------
Insert the .stl file from TOOLS > OPTIONS > MACHINE > ADD

2nd WAY
-------
i.  Copy & paste Ender3bed.stl to "C:\Program Files\Simplify3D-4.0.1"
ii. Run Simplify3D and import .fff file "Creality Ender-3.fff" from FILE > IMPORT FF PROFILE

(The fff file has been created combining a lot of other fff files and a lot of testing from me!)
